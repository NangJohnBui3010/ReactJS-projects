## Overall performance

This front end app demonstrates 3 main React features:

### `Controlled form`
All three input fields (Name, Age, Gender) are constantly updated as user typed in. 

### `Conditional rendering`
You're not allowed to register if under 18.\
The Submit Button is disabled until all inputs are valid.\
A red warning will pop up if the user enter an age <= 18. 

### `fetching data`
The website will fetch data from ("https://randomuser.me/") to match with user based on gender.
